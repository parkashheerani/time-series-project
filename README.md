Seasonal - Rainfall in Pakistan

Pakistan faces flood and drought more often than anyone can believe in different parts of the country year after year and the cycle seems to continue infinitely. I've created this dataset to find out if there is anything we can learn from hisotry and if we can co-relate in with global weather patterns and climate change.

The dataset contains 116 yeas of rainfall data in millimeters. The granularity is per month average rainfall.

Non-Seasonal - GDP of Pakistan
